Flashkeeper

[Visit Flashkeeper Documentation](https://flashkeeper.org)

This project is developing Flashkeeper, a device that can be permanently installed on a common SOIC-8/WSON-8 flash chip. It attaches to the chip with a peel-and-stick layer and spring-loaded contacts or low-profile solder-down flex cable, interfacing with the SPI flash pins for easy write protection and external reprogramming (unbricking). For users concerned with physical attacks on their systems, for whom easy access to SPI flash pins may be seen as a risk, a variant including a microcontroller (MCU) is also being developed, allowing authenticated external reprogramming and WP control, and independently verifying the SPI flash image against a user-controlled signature each boot.
